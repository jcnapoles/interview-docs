## What would you do to avoid the SQL Injection problem?

There are a few things you can do to avoid the SQL Injection problem:

1.Use parameterized queries or prepared statements: Instead of directly concatenating user input into SQL queries, use parameterized queries or prepared statements. This ensures that user input is treated as data and not executable code.

Input validation and sanitization: Validate and sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries. This can involve checking for expected data types, length limits, and using functions like htmlspecialchars or mysqli_real_escape_string to escape special characters.

Least privilege principle: Ensure that the database user account used by the application has the minimum required privileges. This reduces the potential impact of an SQL Injection attack.

Implement a web application firewall (WAF): A WAF can help detect and block SQL Injection attempts by analyzing incoming requests and blocking suspicious patterns.

Regularly update and patch your database software: Keep your database software up to date with the latest security patches to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
