# What are hooks in React and how to use them?

Hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. Examples include `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, etc. For example, the `useState` hook is used to handle local state:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
