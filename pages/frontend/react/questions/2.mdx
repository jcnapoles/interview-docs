# What is state in React and how is it used?

State in React is an object that represents the dynamic state of a component. It is used with the `useState` hook in functional components or in the constructor of class components.

For example:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
