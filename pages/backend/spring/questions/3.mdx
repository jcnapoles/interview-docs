# What is Dependency Injection in Spring?

Dependency injection is a design pattern that allows dependencies to be created outside of a class and injected into that class. In Spring, this is achieved by using annotations such as `@Autowired`, `@Inject`, or by configuring in XML files.

For example:

```java
@Component
public class MyService {
    public void serve() {
        System.out.println("Service called");
    }
}

@Component
public class MyController {
    private final MyService myService;

    @Autowired
    public MyController(MyService myService) {
        this.myService = myService;
    }

    public void doSomething() {
        myService.serve();
    }
}
```
