# What is Spring Data JPA and how to use it?

Spring Data JPA is a Spring project that facilitates the implementation of JPA (Java Persistence API) based repositories. It is used to interact with relational databases by using predefined interfaces and methods.

For example:

```java
@Entity
public class User {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private String email;
    
    // Getters and setters
}

public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
    List<User> findByName(String name);
}
```
